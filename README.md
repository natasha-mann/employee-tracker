## About the Project

This app was built using Node.js and the inquirer package for the back end, with MySQL for the database. The user is prompted with a set of choices representing actions that can be taken to manipulate the data.

The user is able to build up data for a company, with tables for departments, job roles and employees. Once the data has been added, the user can view the data tables in the terminal using the "view" options, or can choose to add to, update or delete certain data.
